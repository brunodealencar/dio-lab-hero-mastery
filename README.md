### ❓ What is this repository about?

Here, you'll find a project that's been developed for emphasizing the **programming logic** structure, using **JavaScript** for that.

Basically, it consists on creating a simple object — 'Hero' from 'src/hero.js' — which contains a string and an integer properties — 'heroName' and 'currentExp', respectively). 

* Hero.heroName ➡ value typed by user through terminal.
---
* Hero.currentExp ➡ random value between MIN_EXP (100) and MAX_EXP (12000).

> The **user interaction** towards 'Hero.heroName' performs according to **"node:readline"** module on **'src/main.js'**.

Then, when user has entered a name and the random value has been sorted, it calls an inner method of Hero object that **prompts a standard message on terminal** — stating the current rank-title of the supposed character based on the 'Hero.currentExp' sorted.

>More info. about the rank gap proportions in [lab-rules/message-template.txt](https://github.com/brunodealencar/dio-lab-hero-mastery/blob/main/lab-rules/message-template.txt).
